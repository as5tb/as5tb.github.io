    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I found a clip of Dave Gorman talking about fake advertising for computer games on TV.  I thought about the adverts that I have seen on TV for computer games and realised that I have seen adverts with the caption "not actual game footage" so I concluded that Dave Gorman was right.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
