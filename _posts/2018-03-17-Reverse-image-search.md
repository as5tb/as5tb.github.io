    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned what a reverse image search was on Google to make sure that I understood it.  I then thought of an image that would be found frequently on the internet.  I choose an image of Queen Elizabeth I as we are studying it in history and I thought it would also be relevant to the history project that we are doing.</td>
